# Discussion Notes
Here is a list of notes and summaries about what we discussed in last Thursday's project discussion on Thursday, October 15th.

## Coming Up in CSC 210

Just to be clear, in CSC 210 there are **Projects** and there are **Assignments**.  

- With **Assignments** you are expected to use the Flask framework as prescribed or demonstrated, and to publish your work on UR Digital Scholar
- With **Projects** you have more latitude to experiment and use your own creativity, and you can publish your application using any means

There are a few more assignments coming up.  

- You'll need to practice the last two basic **database functions**: updating and deleting (part of the C.R.U.D. set of functions)
- Also **user authentication** and **account management**
- Also, in preparation for the group project, you will need to learn about basic project management skills and industry standard tools

## The Final Projects

Regarding the discussion about doing one project versus multiple projects: there will be **two projects**; each will come with a list of functional requirements that you'll need to fulfill (coming soon)

- **Individual** - a web app based on any topic, using any data (25% of your final grade)
- **Group** - a recipe-based app (25% of your final grade)

### Individual Project

The exact requirements list and due date for the Individual Project will be coming soon. In the meantime, here is what you should expect.

- The topic/purpose of the individual project needs to be **new and novel**, i.e. unique
- You can **use any means** you want to create and publish your web app, although there will be specific requirements coming soon
- At a bare minimum, the web app will need to demonstrate **all four basic database functions** (the C.R.U.D.)
  - Other features like user authentication, account management, et cetera will be optional but you'll need to include them *if* it makes sense for the application you design
- You will need to **write-up a proposal** of what you plan to build, and you'll need to turn it in by a certain due date (coming soon)

### Group Project

The exact requirements list and due date the Group Project will be coming soon. In the meantime, here is what you should expect.

- You will need to **join a team** of *three* people and establish your role within the MVC paradigm
  - There will be advice and discussions about how to create an effective team, although in the end everyone will be free to form their own team
  - Teams of two will be allowed if we cannot split everyone into teams of three only
  - Teams of one will not be allowed
  - Teams of more than three will not be allowed
  - HINT: remember when we introduced ourselves in #chatter channel in Slack?  Now would be a good time to start reviewing some of those introductions 
- Your team can **use any means** you want to create and publish the group project, although there will be specific requirements coming soon
- Your project will be required to use the recipe database (coming soon); what exactly you do with the data is up to your team

- The app will need to demonstrate **all four basic database functions** (the C.R.U.D.)
- The app will need to demonstrate **user authentication**, **account management**, and a few other things (coming soon) 
- Your team will need to **write-up a proposal** about the functionality you want to include and how your app will work, and you'll need to turn it in by a certain due date (coming soon)

## One More Thing

All projects, individual and team, will be required to:

- Publish their source code in a public GitHub repository
- Include a "colophon" that describes how the web app was built, and by who
- Be added to a master index that'll be published on the public web so everyone can see everyone else's projects
