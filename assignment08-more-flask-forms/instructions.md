# Assignment 8: More Flask Forms

*Due: Thursday, October 8, 2020*

Your assignment is to experiment with using Flask to generate another HTML form by creating a new application (not related to your recipe web page), and demonstrate that you can capture user input and then display it in an HTML table by your own design.

You'll need to follow the two video tutorials (linked below) to learn a new pattern of delivering HTML forms using Flask, and then use a little creativity to extend it.

**Warning:** this time you'll be working with a brand new application that you need to figure out how to build from scratch because this assignment is *not* based on code from the book.  

Also note that the presenter in these videos is using some pre-written code from previous videos.  You are not expected to go back and watch those videos, rather you should know enough about Flask at this point to work around the missing parts.  For instance, in the videos, you'll see references to routes like '/about' and '/blog' that have nothing to do with this assignment.  You should understand that that's not important and you can ignore those parts.

Also, when you see the presenter create a new HTML file that extends a **base.html** template ...you have to realize that, in this assignment, you don't have a **base.html** file! Then you have to decide: do you create a **base.html** file?  Do you skip it?  You need to know enough about how Flask works to figure out these things for yourself.  (Hint: it doesn't matter - it's up to you.  Just make sure the application works!)

## Video Tutorials

Watch these videos* and follow along to create a similar application that allows a user to enter data, and then see the entered data on another webpage.  

1. [Python and Flask - Web Forms with Flask-wtf (YouTube)](https://youtu.be/-O9NMdvWmE8)
2. [Python and Flask - Getting data from Web Forms (YouTube)](https://youtu.be/f8qvLBvrIFI)

At this point, you should have a working local application, similar to what you saw in those videos.  But that's not what you'll turn-in for this assignment.

*\* Yes - these are the same videos that were embedded in the lecture video* 

## Requirements

Starting with what you saw in the reference videos (above), you need to *extend* the functionality of the demo to include:

- More data types
- More validation
- Custom labels
- Appropriately named variable and function names

The exact amount of new fields in the form and how you code it is up to you.  Just remember that the goal of this assignment is to demonstrate mastery of the Flask framework to capture and use user-inputted data.

**Another requirement: ** make your HTML form captures *"recipe related user input"* ...something that might potentially be used with your recipe webpage, sometime in the future.  BTW - don't worry: whatever you put together for Assignment 8 is *not* a commitment to use it later, but it's important that you start thinking in those terms.

## Turn-in Your Work
