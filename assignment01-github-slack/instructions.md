# Assignment 1: GitHub/Slack Accounts
*Due: Tuesday, September 1, 2020* 

Your assignment is to simply create accounts in the online tools we'll be using this semester in CSC 210 if not already.  Also, you need to introduce yourself to the other students in CSC 210 because you'll be doing a group project later in the semester and you need to know who's who.

## Access the CSC 210 Workspace in Slack

### Step 1: Create your Slack account for CSC 210

We will use Slack as our primary way to keep in contact with each other, and you'll use slack to get technical help in lieu of attending an in-person lab

- Go to [join.slack.com/t/csc210/signup](https://join.slack.com/t/csc210/signup) and setup your account (if you haven't already)


### Step 2: Introduce Yourself 

Later in CSC 210 you will form teams to work on projects.  The best teams are made of students with technical skills that compliment each other.  You need to get to know the other students in CSC 210.

- Go to the **#chatter** channel in the CSC 210 Slack Workspace
- Create a new message to introduce yourself; write whatever you want; minimally:
  - Your nickname, or how you like to be referred to if different from your *display name* in Slack
  - Your major(s), minor(s), et cetera
  - Any clubs or teams to which you belong
  - Your abilities in any of the following, which will be important to know later in CSC 210:
    - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (not counting website builder tools like Wix, Squarespace, etc.)
    - Python
    - SQL
  - ...be sure to list courses you're taking or have taken related to these things^

# Git / GitHub

We will be using Git for source control in this class.  

- If you haven't already, [create an account in GitHub](https://github.com/join)

If you are not familiar with Git or GitHub, you need to learn! It will be important to become familiar with basic Git commands and you should take this opportunity to practice.  

- Here is a good introduction if you need to learn basic Git concepts and commands: [An Introduction to Git and GitHub by Brian Yu (YouTube 28:26)](https://youtu.be/MJUJ4wbFm_A)

Note: it's important to know how to use Git from the CLI (command line interface), but it's acceptable for CSC 210 to [use the GitHub Desktop software application](https://desktop.github.com) instead.
