# CSC 210 Final Project

The CSC 210 final project is delivered in multiple parts, described below.  The last part - delivery of an actual web application - is considered your *final exam* for the course.

**The goal of the project** is to demonstrate your ability to create a **new and novel** web application using a framework that meets the requirements described below.

## Functional Requirements

- A web application using a **web framework**
  - Note: it is required that you use a web framework to build the application, but it does not necessarily have be *Flask*, however if you choose to use another framework(s) with which to build the application, <u>check with the professor</u> to make sure it's appropriate for use in CSC 210
- The web application must be **installed on a production web server** 
  - Note: the production web server does *not* have to be UR Digital Scholar
- Use of a **backend database** to perform *at least* three of the four basic database functions
  - Note: the database does *not* have to be SQLite
  - Also note, a non-normalized database of **recipes** will be provided that you can use *optionally* to create a recipe-based application, or you can forgo the use of the recipes and use whatever data makes sense for your application
- Use of **user authentication** and basic user **account management**
  - The requirements and objectives of user authentication and account management is described in the *Flask Web Development* book (Grinberg), chapter 8
  - Note: you do *not* have to use the book's implementation of user authentication and account management so long as your web application fulfills the intent of its requirements and objectives
- Have a **reasonable purpose** approved by the professor; i.e. you are *not* permitted to create a trivial application that nominally meets functional requirements, but has no real purpose

...that's it!  How you demonstrate those requirements is totally up to you.

## Other Requirements

- The source code for the project must be maintained in a **public GitHub repository**

- You must work in **a team of three or four students** to work on a single, approved project idea, and balance the work among the team

## Part 1: Initial Ideas

*5% of the final grade*

*Due: Tuesday, November 10*

The purpose of this exercise is to get everyone started thinking about application design. It's not meant to be a particularly taxing exercise - everyone *should* pass - however you do have to put some thought into it and be able to describe an idea in very few words.

**Everyone must post an idea** (at least one) on [our shared Tutorials and Ideas Google Sheet, on the Final Project Ideas tab](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sLVw6UWpY4K66Z32Xu3Pw9Lp-xgXGgagto_YrTUl35w/edit#gid=52214594)

This exercise will be graded as "pass" or "not passed yet" i.e. there is no fail until Tuesday, November 10.

Overly vague or overly ambitions project ideas will not pass.

The professor and TAs will provide feedback that will indicate if or when youâ€™ve completed this portion of the project

- The idea(s) posted is not a commitment, rather just a "conversation starter" that sounds viable and realistic
- Note: you may flex (build upon) other students' ideas (that's the point of sharing the ideas in a place that everyone else can see)
- Each idea may include links to "resources" which can be open source apps or tutorials that are functionally similar, for the purpose of helping to explain the idea and letting others understand the proposed solution

## Part 2: Team Building

*not graded*

*Team Building Phase: Thursday, November 5 through Tuesday, November 10*

Everyone must join a team of web developers using [our shared Team Building Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ou9MFoP_8cb3TCGpfL0PIDeA_1bNWJTsWqM2GshVYIs/edit#gid=0)

- **Thursday, November 5 - during the regularly scheduled class time:** the process to join a team will start and be explained in real-time; students may begin to choose teams at this time
- **Friday, November 6:** TAs begin to assign some remaining students to teams
- **Monday, November 9:** Professor will assign the last students to teams

## Part 3: Project Proposal

*10% of the final grade*

*Proposal due: Thursday, November 12, 2020*

Your team must turn-in a proposal that describes in detail the application you plan to build.  

The proposal document must follow typical college-level style and formatting norms with things like, title, team member names, date, et cetera.  There should be no spelling mistakes, typos, or grammatical errors, and the document should be easy to read and understand.

The proposal must explain the following.

- **THE PLAN:** what application will you build 
  
  - A short name for the application
  - A description about its purpose and capabilities
  - Target audience (users) and the goal(s) that the application helps them fulfill
  - Features and functions list(s) that fulfill the functional requirements
  
  *NOTE: plans change, but if you end-up building something that deviates from the plan, you'll need to document exactly what changed, why, and what you did instead*
  
- **THE TEAM:** decide who will do what
  
  - Define each team members' responsibilities in terms of who will build what part of the application and be accountable for it
  - Note: at the end of the project it doesn't really matter who did what so long as everything is complete and done correctly, and no one feels slighted by having to cover for anyone else

## Part 4: Weekly Sprint Planning Meetings

*Each meeting will be graded separately to total 15% of the final grade*

*Every week, as scheduled with your team's TA between Thursday, November 12 and Wednesday, December 9 - minimum three Sprint meetings*

Note: each planning meeting will be graded; there will be no make-ups or recovery for mistakes!  

- The ScrumMaster (designated team member) must deliver a live report, at a safe distance, to their Product Owner (TA) based on an agreed upon weekly schedule
  - Note: the best meetings are attended by all members of the team so everyone can *chime in* as needed to make the best presentation; leaving the report to only one team member is risky
- During the Sprint meeting the following information must be reported:
  - Reminder: what is being built and what was the plan from the previous week
  - Results: what actually got built, including a code walk-through and demo
    - Point out bugs identified; bugs fixed; ongoing issues
  - Plan: what will be delivered next week

## Part 5: Final Delivery

*20% of the final grade*

The final application must be turned-in on Blackboard no later than Wednesday, December 9

The submission in Blackboard must include:

- A link to the working web application online
- A compressed (ZIP) file of the web application
- A link to the team's public repository
- A list of the names of everyone on the team and a statement of generally, who did what to build the application

## Work Team Process and Conflict Resolution

- At the end of the project, everyone on a team will get the same grade based on the results of the project
- If it is determined that some team member(s) did not do their share of work, points will be transferred *from* the student(s) who failed *to* contribute, *to* whomever did the work, resulting in a scores that can exceed 100%, i.e. a zero-sum distribution of the points.  
- For example, if it is determined that one person in a team of three did all the work, that one person would get a score of 300% and the other two would get 0%

### Team Work Balance

During the weekly Sprint meetings and at the end of the semester, the TAs and professor will monitor work balance among the teams and *if* it is determined that there was an imbalance in effort:

- The TAs and professor will require statements from each team member regarding who did what, and their perceived contributions to the project
- The TAs and professor will review the commits in the repository

- The professor will be the final arbiter in regard to imbalanced work issues

*BTW - it's understood that not all team members are exerting the same level of effort throughout the project. At some points in the project plan, some team members will need to wait for another team member to finish their part.  That's okay.  It's normal.*
