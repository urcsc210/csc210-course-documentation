# Discussion Notes

Here is a list of notes and summaries about what we discussed in the discussion on Tuesday, October 20th.

## Tutorials and the "Plain Vanilla Demo"

For the next assignment (Assignment 10: CRUD) coming out tomorrow, Thursday, October 22, you need to have found a **flask crud sqlite tutorial**, and have learned from it

- Recommended: re-create the app from whatever tutorial you found as a clean "plain vanilla" demonstration to make sure you understand how the code works
- The goal here: understand the code well enough to be able to apply it to your recipe webpage (Assignment 10)

Also, be aware that the particulars of whatever tutorial you found are probably *not* compatible with the way you built Assignment 9.  So most likely, you'll have to rip-out some of your controller code to make Assignment 10 work.

## Final Project

- In prep for writing an **Individual Project Proposal** (required for the individual part of your final project), strongly recommended: brainstorm and discuss ideas with the professor and others in CSC 210
  - Be prepared to talk about your ideas tomorrow (Thursday, October 22)
