# Assignment 10: CRUD Recipe

*Due: <s>Tuesday, October 27, 2020</s>* Updated: Thursday, October 28, 2020

This assignment requires you to find your own tutorial that uses Flask and SQLite, and then create your own CRUD app based on it.

1. **Find a good tutorial** that explains how to create a CRUD app that reads & writes information to a **SQLite database**. The tutorial should:
   - Show you how to setup and use SQLite to create, read, update, and delete records in a Flask app
   - Provide sample code to build a complete app that you can follow along 
2. REQUIRED: when you have a good tutorial that helps you build a working copy of their demonstration, **share the information** and link in our [Google Sheet: Tutorials and Ideas](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sLVw6UWpY4K66Z32Xu3Pw9Lp-xgXGgagto_YrTUl35w/edit#gid=1404322235), in the Tutorials tab
3. Build the app shown in the tutorial to create your own **“plain vanilla” demonstration** to make sure you understand how the code works
   - This part is *not* turned-in; it's for your use only
4. Create a new instance of your Assignment 9 recipe webpage - call it Assignment 10, and install the functionality to allow users to do all four database functions on the ingredients list
5. Install the working app on UR Digital Scholar

## Turn it in

Go to the **Assignment 10: CRUD Recipe** in Blackboard.

- Provide the link to your app on UR Digital Scholar
- ZIP (compress) the project folder that contains the app and attach the ZIP file to the assignment submission
- In the "Write Submission" area in Blackboard, paste a link to the tutorial you used to create your *plain vanilla demo*
