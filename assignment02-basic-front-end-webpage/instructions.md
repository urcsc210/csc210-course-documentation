# Assignment 2: Basic Front-end Webpage
*Due: Tuesday, September 8, 2020* 

Your assignment is to create a simple, single-page website that fulfills the requirements of this assignment

## Requirements

### Content

- The subject matter of the webpage must be a recipe - any recipe
- The source of the recipe must be another website somewhere on the Web
- You must replicate the *content* of the recipe (name, description, ingredients, procedure) and include photos (embedded videos okay, but not required), but the *presentation* must be uniquely yours
- You must cite the source of the recipe somewhere in your webpage as hypertext (a link)
- You must embellish the recipe with your own words and photos - personalize it!

### Source Code

RULE #1: there will be group projects later in the semester, but for this assignment: **your code must be your own - written by you**.  This is not an assignment to demonstrate how you can use a code generator or framework - we'll be doing that later in this course.  The purpose of this assignment is to see if you really understand the technology that underpins all of that.

- You must write the HTML and CSS yourself
- JavaScript is not required, but would be nice; it's okay to use JS libraries and plugins but if you do, see the section below

**Exceptions to Rule #1:**

- You may not copy/paste chunks of code, nor re-type code from another source line-by-line, however it is okay to get *inspiration* from other websites and to get help from other people (especially our TAs)
- If you think your code is very close, or could be mistaken for someone else's code, you may leave comments in the code that clearly states its source
- You may use JavaScript libraries and plugins (nice, but not required for this assignment), but if you do, make sure the source of the libraries/plugins are clearly stated in the comments

Violations of this rule are subject to the University's rules on plagiarism.

## Publish and Report your Work

To upload your files to the class web server, you'll need to use some FTP software.  There are lots of kinds of FTP software you can use. If you already know about this and have your own preference, you can use it. Else, if it doesn’t matter:

- Use **WinSCP** for Windows
- Use **Cyberduck** for Mac

To install your own: **WinSCP** (Windows only) go to [winscp.net/eng/download.php](http://winscp.net/eng/download.php)
…then click the green button, “DOWNLOAD WINSCP…”

To install **Cyberduck** go to: [cyberduck.io](http://cyberduck.io/)
…then click “Download,” for Windows or OS X

After you've installed the FTP software you're going to use...

- Install your webpage on the **class web server** using the FTP credentials below

Note: **everyone will use the same FTP account**. Be careful *not* to disturb other students' files!

```
FTP Server (a.k.a. Hostname): ftp.csc174.org   //yes ...csc174, not csc210!!!
FTP Port: 21
FTP Username: assignment01@csc174.org          //again, csc174
FTP Password: [see the #announcements channel in Slack]
```

- When you FTP-in to the account, **create a folder using your UR NetID** (e.g. rkostin) and place your webpage files in there

### Check Your Work

- Open a web browser and go to this web address, below, where “*username*” is your UR NetID  (example: **rkostin**) and "*filename*" is whatever you called your HTML file (example: **index**)

  `http://csc210.org/assignment01/username/filename.html`

If you did everything correctly, you should see your simple webpage with your name on it.

### Report your Work

- In our CSC 210 section in Blackboard, in **Assignment 2: Basic Front-end Webpage** , click the "Write Submission" button then in the text box...
  - Post the URL (not the actual files) to your webpage on the class web server
