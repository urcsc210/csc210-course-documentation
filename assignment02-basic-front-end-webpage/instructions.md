# Assignment 2: Basic Front-end Webpage
*Due: Tuesday, September 8, 2020* 

Your assignment is to create a simple, single-page website that fulfills the requirements of this assignment

## Requirements

### Content

- The subject matter of the webpage must be a recipe - any recipe
- The source of the recipe must be another website somewhere on the Web
- You must replicate the *content* of the recipe (name, description, ingredients, procedure) and include photos (embedded videos okay, but not required), but the *presentation* must be uniquely yours
- You must cite the source of the recipe somewhere in your webpage
- You must embellish the recipe with your own words and photos - personalize it!

### Source Code

RULE #1: there will be group projects later in the semester, but for this assignment: **your code must be your own - written by you**.  This is not an assignment to demonstrate how you can use a code generator or framework - we'll be doing that later in this course.  The purpose of this assignment is to see if you really understand the technology that underpins all of that.

- You must write the HTML and CSS yourself
- JavaScript is not required, but would be nice; it's okay to use JS libraries and plugins but if you do, see the section below

**Exceptions to Rule #1:**

- You may not copy/paste chunks of code, nor re-type code from another source line-by-line, however it is okay to get *inspiration* from other websites and to get help from other people (especially our TAs)
- If you think your code is very close, or could be mistaken for someone else's code, you may leave comments in the code that clearly states its source
- You may use JavaScript libraries and plugins (nice, but not required for this assignment), but if you do, make sure the source of the libraries/plugins are clearly stated in the comments

Violations of this rule are subject to the University's rules on plagiarism.

## Publish and Report your Work

- Sync your local files to a **public repository on GitHub**
- Install your webpage on the **class web server** using the FTP credentials below

Note: **everyone will use the same FTP account**. Be careful *not* to disturb other students' files!

```
FTP Server (a.k.a. Hostname): ftp.csc174.org   //yes ...csc174, not csc210!!!
FTP Port: 21
FTP Username: assignment01@csc174.org          //again, csc174
FTP Password: [see the #announcements channel in Slack]
```

- When you FTP-in to the account, **create a folder using your UR NetID** (e.g. rkostin) and place your webpage files in there

### Report your Work

- In our CSC 210 section in Blackboard, in **Assignment 2: Basic Front-end Webpage** , click the "Write Submission" button then in the text box...
  - Post a link (not the actual files) to your webpage on the class web server 
  - Post a link to your repository in GitHub (make sure it's a Public repository)
